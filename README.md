Line Tracking with TurtleBot3 (ROS1 Noetic)

This project implements a line-following robot using a TurtleBot3 platform in ROS1 Noetic. The robot detects and follows a path based on the intensity values of lines on the ground, rather than relying on color segmentation.

A PID controller is implemented to minimize the error between the robotâ€™s position and the center of the line, ensuring smoother and more stable tracking performance. The controller parameters can be tuned for different environments or simulation/real-world setups.
